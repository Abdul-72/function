//     Explain JS execution. Including explanation of what is call stack, execution context, creation phase and execution phase?


//  we need an environment to execute the code that is called as execution context 

//  global execution context is the default execution context 

//  when ever we create any function all the functions are there in the global execution context  itself 


//  if we call any function then it will create a execution context 




//    HOSTING    

//  hostins is a procedure  in which variabes and function will get their memory allocated , declared any variables get memory allocated as undefined 

// since var is global scope the value is undefined in the global scope and for let and const the value will be undefined in the local scope 

//  make sure if u r using let and const initialize them before you use them 






// Explain passed by value and passed by reference       


//  passsed by values are used in premetive data types that the vales will not cahnge it will remain the same , use function and pass the value 


//  passed by refrence is the used for non premetive data types 




//  immediately invoked function 




































// Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?

//  yes javascript is a dynamically typed language , 

// suppose if you have created  a variable of data type as number then later on you can change the data type as you wish , you can  change the data type dynamically
